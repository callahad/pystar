Color Wall
==========================================

The ColorWall is a framework for implementing and displaying 
effects for a wall of pixels. During this workshop, you will write 
your own ColorWall and design effects for it.

Download the files you will need here:

- Linux/Mac Users

  - :download:`ColorWall.tar.gz </resources/ColorWall.tar.gz>` 
  - :download:`WorkshopExercises.tar.gz </resources/WorkshopExercises.tar.gz>`

- Windows Users 

  - :download:`ColorWall.zip </resources/ColorWall.zip>`

Basic Programming
-----------------------------
First let's work through some basic terminal exercises to learn how
we use Python to work with numbers & text.

Workshop Exercises
------------------------------
Unzip/Untar the workshop exercises and go through them.

Layout
-----------

The ColorWall code consists of 3 files:

- ``run.py`` -- takes arguments from your environment (like a specified width and height for the wall), set up the wall and effects, and run them.
- ``wall.py`` -- the logic behind the matrix of squares that make up the wall. This file has a comment block at the top that summarize the interface that you will use when programming your own effects.
- ``effects.py`` -- where effects live. This is the main file that you'll be editing during the workshop.

Run the ColorWall
---------------------------
If you want to try doing a git clone, you can grab
the ColorWall code from `Git Hub <https://github.com/jesstess/ColorWall>`_
and run it from there, otherwise go into the directory that was created when 
you unzipped/untarred the ColorWall download.

Run the example effects:

On Windows, assuming the ColorWall software was downloaded to ``C:\Users\yourusername\Desktop\ColorWall``

.. code-block:: bash

   run \Python27\python.exe "C:\Users\yourusername\Desktop\colorwall\ColorWall\run.py"

On OS X, assuming the ColorWall software was downloaded to ``~/Desktop/colorwall/ColorWall`` run

.. code-block:: bash

   python ~/Desktop/colorwall/ColorWall/run.py

On Linux, assuming the ColorWall software was downloaded to ``~/Desktop/colorwall/ColorWall`` run

.. code-block:: bash

   python ~/Desktop/colorwall/ColorWall/run.py

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV has the
explanation for what HSV color space means. What it boils down
to for the purposes of our project is this: each pixel gets 3
values: hue (e.g. am I red, green, or blue), saturation
(am I pale or intense), and value (am I bright or dark).
effects.py has example effects that
exercise hue, saturation, and value independently
