Advice for Guides
-----------------

Your role is to *support* the learners and help create a good learning environment.

*   Give answers that are appropriate for the stage of learning.
*   Ask if people want more detail before infodumping or editorializing.
*   Speak from your experience.  Do not use the Voice of Authority.
*   Assume learners are capable, but inexperienced.
*   Stay out of the way!  If you are tempted to type on a learner's keyboard,
    you are in danger!  They should do their own typing, and drive their
    own machines.
*   Help learners break down tasks into repeatable, understandable parts.
*   Look for opportunities to empower the learners.
*   Learners should be talking more than you are.
*   Make room for the voices of all learners.  Make space for quieter people
    to speak.
